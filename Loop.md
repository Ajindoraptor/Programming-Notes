Loops:
A control structure used to repeat a block of code multiple times.

For Loops:

A for loop is a loop that iterates through code in its body for a set amount of times, until a predetermined condition returns false. It can be used to execute a pre-determined code with each iteration.

Ex. 
for i in range(0,10,2):

print("i is now", i)

The condition of the loop is "for i set to 0, every time i is less than 10, add 2 to i." This will print out:

i is now 0

i is now 2

i is now 4

i is now 6

i is now 8

While Loops: 

With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.

Ex.

i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1

Break Loop:

The break statement is used to terminate the loop immediately when it is encountered.

Continue Loop:

The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of the loop and the control flow of the program goes to the next iteration.
