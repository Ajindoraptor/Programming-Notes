Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming

Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism, etc in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

Classes of Python:

Classes provide a means of bundling data and functionality together.

Creating classes:

Creating a new class creates a new type of object, allowing new instances of that type to be made. Each class instance can have attributes attached to it for maintaining its state.

Objects:

variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data.

Methods:

functions that are associated with an object and can manipulate its data or perform actions on it.

Properties:

provides an interface to instance attributes.
